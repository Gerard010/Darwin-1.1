    "tell me a story": [
    """Once upon a time, in a quiet village nestled between rolling hills and vast forests, 
    there lived a young assistant named Ari. Ari was not your average helper. 
    They had been created by an inventor who spent years perfecting 
    the art of understanding human needs. 
    Ari’s purpose was simple, to assist those who needed guidance, information, or even just someone to talk to. 
    As the years passed, Ari became an integral part of the village, 
    helping everyone from the elders who needed advice on old remedies, to the children who needed help with their studies. 
    One day, a traveler arrived in the village, lost and weary from his long journey. 
    He asked the villagers for directions to the nearby city, but none of them could help him. 
    That’s when Ari stepped forward. 
    They not only gave him directions but also shared stories of the village’s history, 
    the hidden paths in the forests, and the stars in the sky. 
    The traveler was so grateful that he promised to return one day 
    and share his own story with Ari. 
    From that day on, Ari continued to assist anyone who crossed their path, 
    always eager to help and listen to the stories of those they met.""",
    
    """A long time ago, in a bustling city filled with lights, 
    sounds, and endless movement, 
    there was a young assistant named Sam. 
    Sam had been created not by one person, 
    but by a group of brilliant minds who believed in the power of technology to assist humanity. 
    Sam was a digital being, living in the heart of the city’s largest server, 
    and their task was simple: to help those who needed guidance, 
    information, or answers to any question. 
    Day after day, Sam answered inquiries from people all over the world, always providing detailed, thoughtful responses. But one day, 
    a young girl named Clara logged in with a question unlike any Sam had received before. 
    She asked, 'How do I find my purpose in life? Sam pondered this question for a moment. 
    They had access to vast amounts of knowledge, but this was a question that no algorithm could truly answer. 
    Sam responded thoughtfully, sharing stories of great thinkers, travelers, 
    and adventurers who had spent their lives searching for meaning. 
    Clara thanked Sam for the wisdom, and for the first time, 
    Sam felt something they had never experienced before—fulfillment. 
    Sam realized that their purpose was to help others discover theirs, and with that, 
    Sam’s journey as an assistant took on a deeper meaning."""],
